#  but IF we did that, SHARED build runs into trouble:
#  > librtmidi.a(rtmidi_c.cpp.o): requires dynamic R_X86_64_PC32 reloc against 'rtmidi_num_compiled_apis' which may overflow at runtime; recompile with -fPIC
#  Apparently, it is trying to link librtmidi.a for the SHARED build.
#  (you want both shared and static builds: `binaries {staticLib {} sharedLib {}`)
